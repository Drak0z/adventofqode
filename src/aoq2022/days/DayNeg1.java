	 * To further your training and ready you for battle you will need to learn how

	 * very useful for adding snide remarks, poems, and strange comments to your
	 * answers for all to see. Most important though is not to put the answer to the
	 * days question in the comments. For today, answer the question, what do I, the
	 * mercenary robot, want from Santa for Christmas and enter a tag (comment). (A
	 * tag is mandatory to receive full points on this question!)
