Advent of Qode repository - Starting with 2022

AoQ 2022 is using the Java Spark framework to do some fancy webservices things... Because I thought that would add value
So far, it has only caused more headaches and I'm basically printing to console instead of returning.
Hopefully by the end of the challenge, I'll actually have a "front end"-ish thing working with outputs that are JSON formatted
But I wouldn't hold my breath....
